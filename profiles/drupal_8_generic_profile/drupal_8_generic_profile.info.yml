name: Drupal 8 Generic Profile
type: profile
description: 'This is a Drupal 8 generic profile that contains some modules which should be installed together with the installation of Drupal.'
core_version_requirement: '^8.8 || ^9'

# Optional: Declare your installation profile as a distribution
# This will make the installer auto-select this installation profile.
# The distribution_name property is used in the installer and other places as
# a label for the software being installed.
#distribution:
#  name: Distribution Name
#  # If you want your distribution to pre-select a language you can specify
#  # the language code, as well. This will prevent the user from selecting
#  # a language code in the user interface. While not recommended for generic
#  # community distributions, this can be very useful for distributions that
#  # are tailored to a language-specific audience (for example government
#  # institutions in a certain country) but also site-specific installation
#  # profiles. Note that this language code will also be used when installing
#  # the site via Drush.
#  #
#  # To set your theme as the theme for the distribution installation uncomment the following:
#  #
#  # install:
#  #   theme: my_theme
#  langcode: de
